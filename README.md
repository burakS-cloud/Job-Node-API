## To run the project locally, please navigate to the server and client folders separately and run "npm run start" in both of the folders.

## Stable branch is main, there's another branch called "react-query-unstable" which has some codes in it that are not behaving as expected so it's marked as unstable for now (10/11/2024)

### Spent about 1.5 hour on the Node.js code, that includes looking up the docs of Unsplash (https://github.com/unsplash/unsplash-js)

### Spent about 3 hours on the React code, I was mostly done in 1-1.5 hour but I spent some time to make the code a bit more clean and modular and tried to introduce a data fetching library such as "react query"
### or "tanstack query" with it's new name. The code related to that can be found on the branch named "react-query-unstable".
